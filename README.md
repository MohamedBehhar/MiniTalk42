## The Project
The aim of this project is to create a communication program between two process in the form of a client and a server by using signals.
The only tow allowed signals are SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2, I used bit shifting to send signals from the client to the server, and I decipher the sended signals in the server then I print that string.

## What I Learned
In this project, I discovered a new concept in computer science that is process.
The process is the instance of a computer program executed by one or more threads. While a computer program is a passive collection of instructions usually stored in a file on disk, a process is the execution of these. instructions after being loaded from disk into memory (source wikipedia).
